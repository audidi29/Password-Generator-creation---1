## Password Generator with certain criteria using Javascript

This project was interesting and a little bit hard at the same time, because javascript is new to me . The goal was to generate a password with some criteria, that provides greater security. The length of the password should be at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters; those include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters. The issue I met was some typo in my code, that mess all my work. I learned to pay attention to each details (coma, uppercase or lowercase...) to make my code works perfectly .
